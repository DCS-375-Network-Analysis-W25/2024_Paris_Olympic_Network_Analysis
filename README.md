&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summer Olympic Games is the largest international sport event, which is held every four years. There are more than 10,000 athletes from around the world. These athletes train for years to represent their nations on a global stage and compete for excellence in their respective disciplines. In 2024, the Olympics game was held in Paris three years after 2020 Tokyo Olympics that happened in 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic. There is a dataset in [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) called [Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/paris-2024-olympic-summer-games?select=medallists.csv), which contains all the data of Athletes,  They also offer a rich dataset for exploring global athletic participation, collaboration, and structural patterns across countries and disciplines. This project uses network analysis methods to investigate athlete and country relationships based on shared events, medal achievements, and cross-discipline participation. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central questions of this project are the follwings:
- How are athletes socially connected through shared Olympic disciplines and events?
- Which countries act as central hubs in the global sports network?
- Do certain disciplines foster more interconnection between athletes or countries?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By visualizing and analyzing these relationships through bipartite graphs, one-mode projections, and centrality metrics, we will find the structural dynamics within the Olympic system that go beyond surface-level competition results.
